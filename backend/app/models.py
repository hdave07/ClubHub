# Which tags point at which outcome. Used ONLY as a fallback: when enrichment returns an
# empty outcomes array (the prompt tells it to, for listings too thin to support one),
# the club would otherwise have no edge in the personal graph -- which is built as
# you -> outcomes -> clubs -- and so could never be rendered at all.
#
# Deriving from tags rather than from sop_interest_areas covers every club: 14 rows came
# back with no outcomes, and while 12 had SOP areas, all 14 had tags (minimum tag count
# across the catalog is 1). Tags are already grounded in the source text, so this stays
# inside the "never invent detail" rule.
#
# A tag may point at several outcomes; scoring picks the strongest. Keep every entry of
# FIXED_TAGS represented here -- unmapped_tags() reports any that are missing.
