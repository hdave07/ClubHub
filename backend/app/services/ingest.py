"""One file in -> Event rows out. The pipeline both entrances converge on.

A file can arrive two ways: a club drops a poster in the shared Dropbox folder,
or a user uploads a flier in the app. Both call process_file(). Keeping that
single is what stops the date-safety rule from existing in two places and
drifting apart.

    InboxFile
      -> IngestLog check      (have we already done this file?)
      -> download_file        (dropbox_store)
      -> extract_file         (extraction -- Claude reads it)
      -> get_or_create_club   (matcher -- never guesses)
      -> get_shared_link      (dropbox_store -- provenance)
      -> Event rows + IngestLog

Synchronous, like the modules it calls. Async callers wrap it in
asyncio.to_thread; running it on the event loop would stall every request for
the several seconds extraction takes.

    Three things count as "the same event":

    1. **Same club, same start, near-identical title.** The ordinary case: the
       same poster read twice. Titles are compared fuzzily because the model does
       not transcribe punctuation identically across runs -- one poster produced
       "Fall Hiking Trip - Rattlesnake Point" and "Fall Hiking Trip: Rattlesnake
       Point" on two passes. Two genuinely different events from one club
       starting the same minute is implausible, so club+start is a safe key, and
       the similarity floor stops unrelated titles merging.

    2. **Same club, same source document, near-identical title, DIFFERENT
       start.** A club correcting a date by re-uploading the same file: it was
       edited, its content hash changed, we re-read it, and it now says a
       different day. Without this the old date stays on the live feed forever
       beside the new one.

    3. **Same club, near-identical title, DIFFERENT file, but the poster
       explicitly says it's a reschedule.** A club can also fix a mistake by
       posting a brand new image rather than editing the old one -- provenance
       alone can't tell that apart from next week's ordinary meetup, since both
       look like "same club, similar title, different file, different date."
       The deciding signal is textual: extraction.py asks Claude whether the
       document itself uses reschedule language ("RESCHEDULED", "NEW DATE",
       "corrected to..."), the same way a person reading the poster would know.
       Only when that's true do we search across files at all -- an ordinary
       recurring announcement with no such language still gets its own row.

    Provenance (tiers 1-2) is the default; the explicit signal (tier 3) is the
    deliberately narrow exception, because a false positive there means the
    weekly-meetup case above wrongly collapses into one row every week.

    `exclude` holds rows already claimed earlier in this same extraction, so a
    poster that legitimately lists one event on two dates ("Auditions Oct 3 and
    Oct 5") writes two rows rather than the second overwriting the first.
