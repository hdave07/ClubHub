"""Claude (Sonnet) file extraction: poster/PDF -> structured events + club updates.

Prompt shape (see project spec / CLAUDE.md):
  "Today is {date}, timezone America/Toronto. This file was dropped by a
   student club. Return: doc_type (poster | schedule | roster | other),
   club_name_guess, events[] (title, start, end, location, description,
   rsvp_url), club_updates (meeting_info, links), confidence (0-1),
   uncertainties[]. Only extract what is visibly stated. If the date or
   year is ambiguous, list it under uncertainties instead of guessing."

Safety rule: auto-publish (status="published") only if title + start are
present AND confidence is high; otherwise status="pending_review".
Wrong dates in a live demo are the #1 failure mode -- always pass today's
date and never let the model guess an ambiguous year.

Scope: this module turns bytes into structured data and nothing else. No
database writes, no club matching, no Dropbox. That keeps the safety rule a
pure function of the extracted fields, testable without a network call.

  description that isn't there.
- Report times as local Toronto wall-clock time in naive ISO 8601
  (e.g. 2026-09-24T19:00:00). Do not add a UTC offset or convert the time yourself.
- If the poster does not print a year, infer it from today's date ONLY when the
  result is unambiguous. If there is any doubt, set `start` to null and describe the
  problem in `uncertainties`.
- Same for a missing time of day: if only a date is given, say so in `uncertainties`.
- Set `is_reschedule` to true only if the document itself uses explicit
  reschedule/correction language ("RESCHEDULED", "NEW DATE", "moved to",
  "correction"). A club posting its normal weekly or recurring meeting is NOT a
  reschedule even though the date changed from last time -- that flag exists
  for the specific case of a club fixing a mistake, not for routine announcements.
- `confidence` should reflect how legible and complete this document is: high for a
  clear poster stating an explicit date and time, low for a blurry photo, a partial
  schedule, or anything where you had to work to read it.
- If this isn't an event document at all (a roster, a logo, a random photo), set
