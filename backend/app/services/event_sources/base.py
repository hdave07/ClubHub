"""The contract every event-source adapter implements.

An adapter's only job is to turn one external source into a list of
`ScrapedEvent`. It does not touch the database, decide what gets published, or
filter by date -- `runner.py` does all of that, once, for every source.

That split is deliberate. Three of this project's rules are safety rules, not
preferences: no organizer contact details ever reach a column, no event that has
already happened reaches the feed, and nothing auto-publishes without a title, a
start and a time of day. Spread across N hand-written scrapers those rules get
forgotten exactly once and the failure is silent. Here an adapter physically
cannot skip them, because it never writes a row.

An adapter is a module exposing two names:

    SOURCE_NAME: str    # stable slug, lands in Event.source
    def fetch(*, limit: int | None = None) -> list[ScrapedEvent]

Run `python -m app.services.event_sources.validate` (or
`scripts/validate_adapter.py`) against a new adapter before wiring it up.
