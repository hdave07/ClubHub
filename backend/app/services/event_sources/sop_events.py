"""SOP's event calendar -- the reference adapter, and the worked example the skill points at.

SOP runs The Events Calendar (a WordPress plugin) behind
`/wp-json/tribe/events/v1/events`. That endpoint is what the listing page's own
JavaScript calls, which is exactly the kind of source the scraping-club-events
skill is for: no HTML parsing, no language model, stated start times.

A `fetch_events()` helper for this endpoint has sat in sop_sync.py since the
first sync and was never called by anything. This module is that code finished:
paginated, filtered to future events server-side, organizer contacts dropped,
and returning the adapter contract instead of raw dicts.

Two details worth keeping:

  * **`start_date` filters upstream.** Without it the endpoint returns the whole
    archive and every past event has to be thrown away after transfer. The runner
    filters again regardless -- this just avoids fetching a year of history.

  * **`utc_start_date` is already UTC.** The payload carries both local and UTC
    forms; taking the UTC one avoids re-deriving an offset that the source
    already resolved, including across a DST boundary.
