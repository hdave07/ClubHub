"""Turn an adapter's ScrapedEvents into Event rows, applying every safety rule.

Mirrors ingest.process_file() for the scraped path: same club matching, same
publish gate, same dedupe-then-update shape. The differences are all consequences
of the key -- a Dropbox file has an id and a content hash, a scraped record has an
upstream id or a URL -- plus two rules the file path gets for free and this one
does not:

  * **Future only.** A poster in the Dropbox inbox is something a club just put
    there. A listing API hands back its whole history, so an unfiltered adapter
    fills the feed with last year's events. Filtering here rather than in each
    adapter means a source with no server-side date parameter is still safe.

  * **Contact scrubbing.** SOP's event payloads carry students' personal emails
    in an `organizer` block (CLAUDE.md: never display event-organizer emails).
    The existing defences are at the response layer and in the embedding text,
    both of which a new writer bypasses -- so text is scrubbed before it reaches
    a column.

Run an adapter with `python -m app.services.event_sources.runner <source>`.
