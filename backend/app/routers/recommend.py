"""POST /recommend -- a free-text blurb becomes a ranked, explained shortlist.

    blurb
      -> embeddings.query_clubs()   Voyage + Chroma: ~20 nearest clubs
      -> reranker.rank_clubs()      Claude Sonnet: 5-8 of them, ranked, with a
                                    reason each, plus the student's outcomes
      -> + next_event per club      so the graph can show "what to show up to"

Two stages because they answer different questions. Vector search finds clubs
whose description resembles the blurb; it has no opinion on whether an intense
competition team suits someone who said "not too intense", and cannot explain
itself. The rerank supplies the judgement and the sentence.
