"""POST /upload -- a user photographs a flier in the app and it becomes an event.

The second entrance into the same pipeline the Dropbox watcher uses. The flow is
deliberately "store first, then read":

    bytes from the browser
      -> dropbox_store.upload_file()   Dropbox is the durable store for every
                                       file, however it arrived
      -> ingest.process_file()         the same function the watcher calls
      -> Event rows + a provenance link back to the uploaded image

Uploading to Dropbox before extracting is what keeps Event.dropbox_link
meaningful for user uploads too: an AI-extracted event is only as trustworthy as
the ability to click through and see the poster it came from.

Writing the IngestLog row at upload time (process_file does this) is also what
stops the watcher re-processing the same file when it next scans the folder.
