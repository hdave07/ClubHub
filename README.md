# ClubHub

**Find the clubs that actually fit you at U of T — as a map, not a list — and watch it
update live the moment a club posts something new.**

Built at HackMIT.

## The problem

University of Toronto's official club portal (SOP) lists ~1,250 groups behind a keyword
search across 17 broad categories. It answers "does a club named X exist?" — not "which
of these 1,250 things should *I* actually join?" And it's stale: at the time this was
built, SOP's own events API returned **9 upcoming events for the entire campus.** Real
event info lives on Instagram posters, PDFs pinned to hallway corkboards, and word of
mouth — not in any structured system a new student can search.

Club fairs are a firehose. Most students end up joining whatever their friends already
did.

## What ClubHub does

Three things, done well, rather than ten things done halfway:

### 1. Match — a blurb becomes a ranked, reasoned shortlist

Type what you want out of university in plain English —
*"first-year CS, want internships and friends, not too intense"* — and get back 5–8
clubs, ranked, each with one sentence tying something concrete in the club's own
description to something you actually said. No generic hype; a club that can only get a
generic sentence written about it doesn't make the list.

Under the hood: Voyage embeddings narrow ~250 enriched clubs down to the ~20 nearest by
meaning, then Claude (Sonnet) reads the candidates against your blurb, drops the ones
that don't genuinely fit, and writes the "why."

### 2. The constellation — your matches as a small, living graph

Results render as a personal star graph — **you → your outcomes → clubs → their next
events** — instead of a list of cards. It's deliberately small (15–25 nodes, never the
full 1,250-club catalog) and it reacts: hovering a club or an outcome lights the exact
path that explains it, stars carry a soft cursor-reactive physics, and a club's own
detail panel opens beside the graph instead of replacing it.

Want to look past your own 5–8 matches? **Full Directory** opens the entire enriched
catalog in its own tab — filterable by tag, commitment level, skills-to-build, or
professional field — with its own independent search box that builds its *own* graph,
so exploring never disturbs the constellation you already have.

### 3. Drop a poster, watch it become an event

A club drags a flyer into a shared Dropbox folder (or a student uploads one straight in
the app). Claude reads it — vision for images, native document input for PDFs — and
extracts the event: title, start time, location, RSVP link. If the poster is clear and
Claude is confident, it's live within seconds, badged **"from Dropbox"** with a link back
to the source file. If a date is blurry or ambiguous, the app **asks the person who just
uploaded it** to fill in exactly the missing piece — never a silent queue nobody looks
at, and never a fabricated date on the live feed.

## Why it's built this way

- **The graph stays small on purpose.** A force-directed hairball of 1,250 clubs is a
  worse UI than a search box. The personal graph earns the "creative visualization" only
  because it's scoped to *your* results.
- **Two ingestion paths write to the same tables, honestly.** A synced SOP listing and a
  Dropbox-extracted poster both become `Club`/`Event` rows, tagged by `source`, so the
  app never has to pretend one is more real than the other.
- **A wrong date is worse than no date.** Auto-publish requires a title, a resolved
  start, a time of day, *and* model confidence — anything short of that goes to a human
  for one quick confirmation instead of guessing.
- **Tags are a controlled vocabulary, not free text.** An early pilot with free-form tags
  produced 148 near-duplicate tags across 25 clubs ("academic" / "academic inquiry" /
  "academic support"). A fixed 51-term enum made tags reusable and made filtering in Full
  Directory possible at all.

The full reasoning — and the incidents that produced each rule — is in
[`DECISIONS.md`](./DECISIONS.md). The condensed, code-facing spec (data model,
architecture diagram, hard constraints) is in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md). The original
brainstorm is [`central-hub-for-clubs.md`](./central-hub-for-clubs.md).

                                                React + @xyflow/react: the star graph, Full Directory
```

## Tech stack

| | |
|---|---|
| **Backend** | FastAPI · SQLModel (SQLite) · ChromaDB · Anthropic (Claude Sonnet + Haiku) · Voyage AI embeddings · Dropbox SDK |
| **Frontend** | React + Vite (JavaScript, no TypeScript) · Tailwind v4 · `@xyflow/react` for the star graph |

## Quickstart

**Backend**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate       # .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env            # fill in ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, VOYAGE_API_KEY, DROPBOX_*
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```
The Dropbox watcher starts with the app and re-scans the inbox on every `--reload`
restart. If you're iterating on backend code and don't want that burning Claude calls,
set `DROPBOX_WATCHER_ENABLED=0` first.

**Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                     # http://localhost:5173, proxies /api -> :8000
```
Needs Node ≥ 20.19 (or ≥ 22.12) — the graph's build tooling (`vite`/`rolldown`) won't
install its native binding on an older Node and fails with a confusing "optional
dependencies" error. `node --version` first if `npm run dev` won't start.

**Data**: `backend/data/campus_compass.db` is checked into git with 250 clubs already
synced and enriched. `backend/data/chroma/` (the vector index) is *not* checked in — if
`/recommend` comes back empty or thin, index it once:
```bash
cd backend && python -m app.services.enrichment_batch --index-only --limit 250
```

## Project layout

```
frontend/   React + Vite. src/screens for pages, src/components for the graph/cards/panels,
            src/lib for the API client, filtering, physics and layout math.
backend/    FastAPI + SQLModel. app/routers for the four endpoints, app/services for
            everything that talks to SOP, Dropbox, Claude or Voyage.
```

## Status

Both the backend and the core frontend are built and running against real data — this
isn't scaffolding. Concretely:

- **250 clubs** synced from UofT's SOP portal (sampled proportionally across interest
  areas from 897 unique St. George clubs), **100% enriched** (summary, outcomes, tags,
  commitment) and embedded for search.
- **`/recommend`** is live: vector search + Claude rerank, tested end to end against the
  real database.
- **The constellation and Full Directory** are both built, sharing one soft-physics graph
  and one hover/highlight model between the graph, the cards, and the club detail panel.
- **The Dropbox pipeline** (watcher, extraction, fuzzy club matching, confidence-gated
  publish, human-confirm for ambiguous dates) is built and has been exercised against
  real uploads, including the "couldn't read this clearly" confirmation path.

**Deliberately out of scope for this build**, tracked as roadmap in
[`central-hub-for-clubs.md`](./central-hub-for-clubs.md): accounts/auth, push
notifications, Instagram/Discord scraping, multi-campus support, and a review dashboard
for posters a club drops directly into Dropbox with no one at the keyboard to confirm an
ambiguous date (the in-app upload flow has one; the unattended watcher path doesn't).
